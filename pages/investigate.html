        <h2>Chapter 3: Investigate</h2>
        <small>The Beginning of the End</small>
        <p>
          Suddenly, like a strike of lightning on a cloudless day, a stepladder drops from a hole in the ceiling. <br>
          You made sure to close all the windows tightly as soon as you arrived in the cabin, so you know that there isn’t a snowball-in-hell’s chance of a draught opening up the door to the attic. <br>
          Not willing to leave any corners left unchecked in the cabin that you plan to turn into your home-base for the near future, you cautiously ascend into the dark abyss. <br>
          <b>*creak* <br></b>
          The stepladder below your feet looks like it has experienced a myriad of winters, as every step you take makes the woody steps squirm in high-pitched screams. <br>
          As you ascend to the top of the stepladder, you reach your hands to the walls to feel for a light switch. <br>
          The darkness in the attic is suffocating, almost as if the darkness was a mucous substance that you had to breathe in and through your lungs. <br>
          As an ominous feeling started tingling the back of your neck, you stumble forward and manage to flick a light switch installed on the floor with your right foot. <br>
          Instantly, the murky darkness retreats to any hidden corner in the room it can find, patiently waiting for the next time it can consume its surroundings again. <br>
          A bit blinded by the light, it takes you a moment to adjust your sight to observe you current environment.

        <p>
          The attic looks old, very old. Everything inside is caked in dust – who knows how many years if not decades have passed since it was abandoned. <br>
          You spot a desk with what appears to be a wind-up toy box on it, together with a ring, a hand-mirror, and a statue of a winged creature. <br>
          Curious, you step over closer to the desk, eager to investigate the bizarre trinkets that lay upon it, as if they were antiques displayed that needed to be taken to a museum. <br>
          Unbeknownst to you, though, the darkness hidden in the corners of the attic appears to start shifting and squirming with unbridled excitement.
