        <h2>Chapter 2: Right</h2>
        <small>Prologue</small>
        <p>
          After making up your mind, you start walking up the desolate road. As you walk, you are reminded of the hope that the future promises. <br>
          Painless nights. <br>
          Smiling when waking from a peaceful sleep. <br>
          A house to yourself – a shelter in which you will be able to nurture your life and hopefully heal the wounds of your soul. <br>
          Everything that could go wrong in an upbringing went wrong, and then some. You are happy that you have finally made the decision to run off. Whatever comes after tonight cannot get worse than your life until now. No chance. <br>
          As relief washes over your body, you notice a pair of flashing car lights heading your way. You hurriedly raise a thumb and wave your free arm at the incoming vehicle, in hopes that they will give you a lift further away from where you are currently at – you are not yet far enough to feel safe. <br>
          Unfortunately, and unsurprisingly to some, the car does not stop and carries down on the road. You hear a clink falling off the car and see that the driver threw out a bottle of Jack Daniel’s. Maybe it is for the best that you did not get noticed and went on a wild, drunken-stupor-in-charge ride.

          However, the lights from the car shine on what appears to be a small cottage by the side of the road. <br>
          Already tired from the previous reckless run and hours of aimless walking, you decide to visit the cottage in hopes that a kind soul will at least direct you to the nearest motel. <br>
          As you approach the cottage, you notice that the windows on the side are cracked, and the wooden exterior seems old and uncared for. <br>
          <i> Is it abandoned…? If so, then maybe I can crash for the night. Better to sleep in dust than in the wild. <br> </i>
          Having made up your mind, you approach the front door. <br>
          As soon as you lift your hand to knock on the door though, it creaks open. You did not feel any wind blowing, but still decide that that is the explanation for the bizarre coincidence. <br>
          You step inside, the wooden floor beneath you creaking in a similar manner to the door. <br>
          As your eyes start to get used to the darkness inside the cottage, you slowly discern your new surroundings. <br>
          The cottage was composed of a single lower floor and an attic. The lower floor contains a living room, a single double-bed bedroom, and a kitchen-cum-toilet (the toilet being nothing more than a hole in the ground). <br>
          Slightly disgusted by the poor condition of the interior, you immediately discipline yourself thinking that it is either this or the side of the road. <br>
          After setting down your backpack and taking out a crude sandwich to satisfy your hunger, you place a flashlight on a table in the living room so that you can avoid eating in the darkness. <br>
          Right after eating, the exhaustion in your body starts to overwhelm you, and you slowly lull into sleep. <br>
          However, soon after falling asleep, you are startled awake by a loud bang somewhere in the cottage. <br>
